This is for UVA online judge.
The code is written in C.
When submitting the solution, I choose g++ compiler because it has less bugs compared to gcc.

When hash table is needed, I use the gnu extension `tsearch`, `tfind` and the like to do the job.
I also made a terrible heap implementation using link-list.

For people whose purpose is to learn a programming language, I would recommend using leetcode
instead of UVA because the former has larger community support, clear problem defintion, and less buggy.
